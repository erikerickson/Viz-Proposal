# Data Visualization Project Proposal
Work associated with WPI Data Viz class

## Data

The data I plan on using for my viz project include:
* The Massaschusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education [(DESE) public data set on Advanced Placement](http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/statereport/ap.aspx) (AP) performance showing the number of students who received each possible score on the Advanced Placement exam for each subject.  This a transformed version of this dataset can be founde [here](https://gist.github.com/erikerickson/c588471f631cd22b6745070eb0adabc0).

* The United States Census geographical data of [school districts in Massachusetts (TIGER)](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2019&layergroup=School+Districts).  This has the shapefiles to create a map of all Massachusetts school districts.

## Prototypes

I have created the first step of the visualization, which was creating a stacked bar chart of the AP data.  It shows a high-level view of general participation and performance across Massachusetts school districts through time.  My goal will be to create a choropleth map of Massachusetts by school district. I would like to slice on different measures that will answer some of the previously identified questions that I found interesting.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

Are there longitudinal patterns of AP Test taking?
Are there AP Performance patterns over time?
Do high test taking schools have relatively high success rates (scores >=3)?
Are there any notable geographical patterns associated with test taking or success?




## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
